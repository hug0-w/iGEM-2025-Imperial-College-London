        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The cost-focused process was designed to prioritise affordability over environmental or operational
            complexity. It features a straightforward linear production line with minimal system redundancy and
            no
            recovery or recycling systems. Media is heat-sterilised in batches and stored in large, jacketed
            vessels.
            Cells are thawed, seeded, expanded, and differentiated in parallel single-use bioreactors. Once
            harvested,
            the biomass is cooled, packaged, and frozen with no further processing or recovery of media or
            cells.
            Cleaning is infrequent and performed manually where possible.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This design mimics the likely setup for early-stage startups with limited funding or technical
            capacity. Its
            simplicity keeps capital and operational expenditure low but comes at the cost of high material
            usage, water
            consumption, and overall environmental burden.

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This design introduces major changes aimed at reducing environmental impact, while still
            maintaining
            economic viability. Inputs such as growth media are reformulated using plant-based ingredients
            (e.g., soy
            hydrolysate, beet sugar) instead of animal-derived or synthetic components. The process replaces
            high-energy
            mechanical agitation with air-lift bioreactors, which improve oxygenation with lower shear and
            energy usage.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Significant changes are made in upstream design: batch sizes are optimised to reduce excess, and
            deep
            cryostorage is replaced with cold-chain liquid storage, reducing energy demands. Cleaning cycles
            (CIP/SIP)
            are integrated into the schedule and simulated in life cycle assessments, revealing a more
            accurate picture
            of water use and emissions.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Overall, this process reduces CO₂ emissions and water use by over 50%, demonstrating that
            sustainable design
            can be achieved without prohibitive cost increases.

        the full system including recovery modules: (1) enzymatic microcarrier digestion for cell salvage, (2)

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The final process adds modular recovery systems to maximise yield and minimise waste. This includes
            enzymatic digestion of microcarriers to recover residual cells, filtration and reverse osmosis to
            recycle
            process water, and automated cleaning cycles with recovery tanks. While the base layout resembles
            the
            environmentally optimised system, additional holding tanks, enzyme steps, and product sorting
            modules
            are
            included.

            This design increases capital cost and system complexity but recovers otherwise lost materials. It
            also
            introduces a secondary product stream: recovered cells that may be repurposed as high-value biotech
            or
            cosmetic ingredients.

    <h2 class="collapsible-trigger" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Design Comparison</strong></h2>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Across the three designs, the strategies change. Design A is linear and simple, aimed at cost
            minimisation.
            Design B introduces sustainable inputs and reactor design choices. Finally, Design C layers on
            complexity to
            close resource loops and extract value from waste along the process.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Each process reflects a different set of priorities. Design A is suited to rapid deployment or low-tech
            environments. Design B shows that smart substitutions and modular design can drastically cut
            environmental
            impact without large added cost. Design C demonstrates that circular processing and recovery systems are
            feasible and offer long-term efficiency gains, but require upfront investment and tighter system
            integration.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Key considerations we made between processes include, sterilisation method (batch vs. continuous),
            storage
            strategy (deep freeze vs. cold liquid chain), Reactor type (stirred-tank vs. air-lift), presence of
            water/cell recovery in the final system. Inclusion of CIP/SIP and their effect on water use and CO₂
            emissions

            Cultivated Meat Processing</strong></h2>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The hybrid process in Design C, contributes a key improvement: it combines environmental and economic
            goals
            in a single, modular layout. It offers a template that balances material cost, operational complexity,
            and
            sustainability, crucial for industries like cultivated meat where margins are tight and scale-up is
            essential.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This staged comparison provides a roadmap for early-stage cultivated meat companies: start lean,
            optimise
            inputs, then close the loop. It also highlights where future bioprocessing efforts, like smarter
            microcarriers or lower-impact cleaning methods, could deliver the greatest gains.
