  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The current model of meat production is <strong>environmentally unsustainable</strong>, driving deforestation, biodiversity loss,
    and global greenhouse gas emissions. <strong>Cultivated meat</strong> offers a promising alternative, yet <strong>remains hindered by high production costs</strong>,
    particularly the <strong>price of recombinant growth factors</strong> that constitute <strong>up to 70% of total expenses</strong>.
    Our project, <strong>Growf</strong>, tackles this challenge by engineering a <em>Komagataella phaffii</em> chassis,
    <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span>, designed to <strong>reduce exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion and improve recombinant protein yield</strong>
    through targeted genetic modifications in <em>Hoc1</em>, <em>Rho1</em>, and <em>PMI</em>. In parallel, we developed
    <strong>BioKernel</strong>, <strong>an open-access, no-code Bayesian optimisation framework</strong> that accelerates experimental design and strain engineering,
    enabling researchers to identify optimal conditions with minimal experiments.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Guided by <strong>Integrated Human Practices</strong>, we engaged <strong>world-leading experts across academia and industry</strong>
    to explore unspoken pitfalls of scaling in yeast chassis. Our <strong>Education</strong> efforts addressed public skepticism toward
    cultivated meat and synthetic biology, recognising that <strong>innovation cannot scale without public trust and investor confidence</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    We were on a mission to make all of our outputs, including genetic constructs, engineered strains, and software
    <strong>fully open-access</strong> reaffirming our belief that <strong>science cannot scale without non-proprietary technology</strong>.
    We aimed to remove cost, accessibility, and licensing barriers in biomanufacturing, accelerating the scalability of cultivated meat
    and paving the way for a more sustainable, ethical, and open future for food.

    <div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The way we produce meat today is <strong>destroying our planet</strong>, and without a sustainable alternative, the cost will be existential.
        The livestock farming industry is a <strong>major contributor to environmental degradation</strong>, responsible for 
        <strong>approximately 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions</strong><sup>[1]</sup>.
        It drives biodiversity loss through deforestation and land-use conversion, while the extensive use of antibiotics in animal agriculture 
        accelerates the spread of antimicrobial resistance<sup>[2]</sup>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        As the global population grows, <strong>the demand for protein will rise correspondingly</strong>, intensifying these pressures
        and forcing us to <strong>confront the urgent need for sustainable and nutritionally complete alternatives</strong> to conventional meat.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Cultivated meat</strong> has been presented as a promising solution due to its structural and nutritional similarity to traditional meat,
        providing a more natural alternative than plant-based substitutes. However, <strong>large-scale adoption remains limited by higher production costs</strong>,
        primarily associated with <strong>cell culture media</strong> and bioreactor scale-up<sup>[3]</sup>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Cell culture media</strong> supplies the nutrients and signalling molecules required for cellular growth and includes expensive recombinant components 
        such as growth factors. Scaling cultivated meat requires bioreactors of 200 to 20,000 L and demands substantial quantities of these expensive media, 
        preventing cost parity with conventional meat<sup>[3]</sup>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Techno-economic analyses consistently <strong>identify growth factors as the primary cost-drivers of cultivated meat production</strong>, 
        contributing up to 70% of total production costs<sup>[4]</sup>. To make cultivated meat economically viable, it is <strong>essential to develop alternative, 
        low-cost recombinant growth factor production systems</strong>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Our project addresses this challenge by <strong>engineering <em>Komagataella phaffii (K. phaffii)</em></strong>, also known as 
        <em>Pichia pastoris</em>, to <strong>produce growth factors more efficiently</strong> — increasing yields and simplifying downstream purification, 
        a core determinant of production economics.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>K. phaffii</em> is a widely used strain for recombinant protein production due to its <strong>well-characterised promoters, eukaryotic post-translational 
        machinery, and high secretion efficiency</strong>. However, <strong>production inefficiencies arise from the secretion of exopolysaccharides (EPS), 
        which co-purify with target proteins and increase purification costs</strong><sup>[5–7]</sup>. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        To mitigate this, we engineered a novel <em>K. phaffii</em> strain, <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span>, designed to <strong>reduce EPS secretion</strong>
        by modulating key enzymes involved in mannose biosynthesis and cell wall formation. By alleviating EPS-associated downstream burdens and carbon waste, 
        <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span> improves growth factor yields and production costs.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Through this work, our goal is to <strong>accelerate the scalability of the cultivated meat industry</strong> by producing cost-effective recombinant growth factors, 
        and advocating for sustainable, ethical food production.

  <details style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">Show Details</summary>
    <div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span> is our <em>K. phaffii</em> strain engineered to minimise
        <strong>exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion</strong>, freeing up more cellular energy for recombinant protein production and increasing yields.
        Specifically, we used a <strong>three-pronged strategy</strong> targeting cell wall integrity and protein glycosylation pathways<sup>[5]</sup>.
      </p>

      <!-- 3.1 Hoc1 -->
      <h4><strong>3.1 Hoc1</strong></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The <em>Hoc1</em> gene encodes a mannosyltransferase required for cell wall construction.
        Most industrial <em>K. phaffii</em> strains contain a <strong>single-base-pair deletion in Hoc1</strong>, causing a frameshift and premature stop codon,
        resulting in a thinner cell wall. While this improves secretion and transformation efficiency, it also disrupts mannose polymer linkage and causes
        <strong>free mannans to be secreted</strong> instead — the primary cause of EPS contamination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Our goal is to <strong>restore and downregulate the original Hoc1 sequence</strong> to enhance active-site specificity and reduce EPS formation.
      </p>

      <!-- 3.2 Rho1 -->
      <h4><strong>3.2 Rho1</strong></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>Rho1</em> is a global regulator of the yeast cell-wall-integrity pathway.
        <strong>Overexpressing Rho1</strong> activates production of β-1,6-glucan, which strengthens the cell wall and promotes proper mannoprotein attachment,
        potentially lowering EPS secretion<sup>[8]</sup>.
        We introduce <strong>Rho1 overexpression</strong> into our strain as an additional mechanism for controlling impurity formation.
      </p>

      <!-- 3.3 PMI -->
      <h4><strong>3.3 PMI</strong></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI)</em> links energy metabolism with GDP-mannose and cell-wall biosynthesis in yeast,
        catalysing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate.
        We plan to <strong>downregulate the PMI pathway</strong> to free more glucose for respiration and lower intracellular mannose levels<sup>[9]</sup>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Collectively, these three edits are expected to yield <strong>higher energy availability, reduced EPS secretion, and simplified downstream purification</strong>
        for recombinant proteins. Experimental validation will be key to confirming these trade-offs.
      </p>

      <!-- 3.4 Licensing restrictions -->
      <h4><strong>3.4 Licensing Restrictions in <em>K. phaffii</em> Engineering</strong></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This genetic-engineering effort faces an additional challenge: the <strong>commercial licensing restrictions</strong> surrounding most industrial
        <em>K. phaffii</em> strains. Even open variants like <strong>OpenPichia</strong><sup>[10]</sup> impose limitations that hinder scale-up and commercialisation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        To address this, we are <strong>collaborating with ChangeBio to develop and characterise non-proprietary K. phaffii strains</strong> for open academic and iGEM use.
        These new strains, based on the Type strain YB-4290, employ split-marker integration with a Cre-Lox system — avoiding CRISPR patents while enabling
        industrially relevant genotypes and phenotypes.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        We selected <strong>growth factors</strong> as our proof-of-concept proteins because they are the most expensive components of cell-culture media
        and thus the main cost barrier to cultivated-meat production.
        Beyond this application, our platform can produce <strong>dietary proteins, hormones, therapeutic proteins and more</strong>,
        making <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span> a versatile chassis for sustainable recombinant production.

        <strong>BioKernel</strong> is our <strong>dry-lab software platform</strong> designed to optimise experimental design and strain engineering in synthetic biology. 
        It applies <strong>Bayesian optimisation</strong> to guide experiments toward optimal outcomes with minimal resources. 
        This framework addresses one of biology’s greatest challenges — the <strong>high cost and low throughput of experimental testing</strong> — 
        by allowing researchers to explore complex biological parameter spaces without coding expertise<sup>[11],[12]</sup>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>Bayesian optimisation (BO)</strong> is a machine-learning strategy that <strong>identifies optimal experimental conditions by learning from prior results</strong>. 
        It constructs probabilistic models balancing <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong>, enabling efficient optimisation even in noisy, high-dimensional systems typical of biological research<sup>[12],[13]</sup>.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        We developed <strong>BioKernel</strong> as a <strong>no-code, modular Bayesian optimisation framework</strong> tailored to synthetic-biology experimentation.
        Its architecture includes:
      </p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li><strong>Modular kernel system</strong> adaptable to diverse biological data types.</li>
        <li><strong>Heteroscedastic noise modelling</strong> to handle variable experimental uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible acquisition functions</strong> allowing exploration–exploitation trade-offs.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch optimisation support</strong> for parallel experiment design.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        To validate our framework, we ran two complementary tests:
      </p>

      <ol style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        <li>
          <strong>Retrospective analysis</strong> on published metabolic datasets demonstrated that BioKernel reproduces known optima using significantly fewer iterations than the original studies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prospective validation</strong> applied our algorithm to optimise <em>astaxanthin</em> biosynthesis in <em>E. coli</em> <strong>Marionette strains</strong><sup>[14]</sup> — 
          a system containing twelve orthogonal genomic sensors enabling multi-dimensional induction control. 
          Using spectrophotometric quantification<sup>[15]</sup>, BioKernel successfully identified optimal inducer combinations that maximised pigment yield faster than traditional grid-search or one-factor-at-a-time methods.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <strong>BioKernel</strong> is the first iGEM software capable of performing advanced optimisation <strong>without requiring programming knowledge</strong>, 
        bridging the gap between computational modelling and experimental design. 
        By releasing it as an <strong>open-source, no-code platform</strong>, we aim to make rigorous, data-driven optimisation accessible to all experimental biologists — 
        accelerating discovery and empowering the next generation of synthetic biologists worldwide.

        Public understanding and trust in cultivated meat are still developing, often shaped by <strong>confusion or skepticism toward synthetic biology</strong>.
        Our educational work aimed to strengthen <strong>trust in science</strong> — particularly synthetic biology — 
        by <strong>demystifying innovation</strong> and encouraging <strong>open, nuanced discussion</strong> rather than simple promotion.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        We explored public perception of scientific innovation through <strong>surveys on cultivated meat and trust in science</strong>, 
        using these insights to guide the design of every outreach resource and event. 
        Our goal was to <strong>bring synthetic biology and alternative proteins into everyday conversation</strong> through curiosity, dialogue, and reflection,
        engaging participants across all age groups.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        We also sought to address the growing <strong>“techno-phobia”</strong> surrounding biotechnology by combining 
        <strong>clear, accessible science communication</strong> with <strong>bioethical reflection</strong>. 
        This dual approach allowed us to promote critical yet constructive engagement with the technologies shaping the future of food and medicine.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Through creative events, educational materials, and collaborations, we encouraged audiences to think about synthetic biology not as a distant science,

        Our Human Practices work guided the project’s direction at every stage, ensuring that our science was 
        <strong>socially aware, ethically grounded, and practically relevant</strong>.
        We carried out a broad investigation of the <strong>precision fermentation and cultivated meat ecosystem</strong>, 
        encompassing academic progress, industrial bottlenecks, and the evolving market landscape.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Through <strong>expert consultations</strong> across academia, entrepreneurship, intellectual property, and industry, 
        we gained insight into both the <strong>technical feasibility</strong> and <strong>societal impact</strong> of animal-free growth factors. 
        These discussions informed our <strong>experimental design, strain engineering, and process optimisation</strong>,
        making our work more attuned to real-world biomanufacturing challenges.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Engaging with a wide range of stakeholders — from startup founders and IP lawyers to researchers in protein expression — 
        helped us understand the <strong>industrial realities shaping the future of cultivated meat</strong>. 
        We learned that many bottlenecks lie not only in technical barriers but also in regulatory, investment, and communication challenges.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        These conversations also made us deeply aware of the <strong>ethical dimensions of innovation</strong>, including 
        transparency, open access, and equitable technology distribution. 
        Our approach was shaped by these values — seeking to advance synthetic biology not as proprietary competition,

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    With <strong>Growf</strong>, we aimed to create <strong>multi-layered impact</strong> — scientific, industrial, and societal.
    At the scientific and industrial level, our work directly addresses long-standing bottlenecks in recombinant protein manufacturing.
    Through extensive stakeholder interviews and literature analysis, we identified core issues within the most commonly used yeast chassis,
    <em>K. phaffii</em>. We then introduced <strong>novel genetic modifications</strong>, including targets like <em>PMI</em>,
    which has not yet been characterised in the research literature.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    If our hypotheses are confirmed experimentally, these modifications could significantly reduce the cost of recombinant protein production
    and simplify downstream purification, saving both <strong>researchers time</strong> and <strong>industry resources</strong>.
    Our <strong>BioKernel</strong> framework further strengthens this impact by dramatically shortening the experimental planning period.
    By providing a <strong>no-code, user-friendly Bayesian optimisation tool</strong>, we made advanced computational design accessible to all biologists,
    improving both efficiency and reproducibility in the lab.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    All our innovations are <strong>entirely open-access</strong>. Every output of our project is intentionally made free for use by the global research and industrial community,
    allowing anyone to build upon our findings without restriction.
    The motivation behind our <strong>ChangeBio collaboration</strong> stems from this same philosophy.
    With our future goal to develop fully <strong>non-proprietary yeast strains</strong>, we are proving that open-access technology is essential to accelerate innovation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Our target industry, the <strong>cultivated meat sector</strong>, stands to benefit immensely.
    By lowering the costs tied to growth factor production, scale-up, and downstream processing, our project tackles the industry’s largest economic and technical constraints.
    The urgency of these improvements was repeatedly emphasised in our <strong>Human Practices interviews</strong> with world-leading figures from the bioprocessing industry.
    These discussions highlighted why our project represents an <strong>unexplored necessity</strong> within both research and industry.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Through these conversations, we also recognised that the future of this industry depends heavily on <strong>venture funding</strong>,
    and that such funding is shaped by <strong>public perception</strong>.
    If the public does not believe in cultivated meat, investors will not either — and without their support, innovation cannot thrive.
    That’s why we placed equal emphasis on <strong>educational outreach</strong>, fostering trust in synthetic biology and cultivated meat alike.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Together, the elements behind <strong>Growf</strong> unite under one mission: <strong>to enable a better future for humanity</strong>.
    Whether through accessible, sustainable protein production or by reshaping how science is shared,
    our work strives to redefine what it means for biotechnology to serve the world.
