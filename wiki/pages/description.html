  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The current model of meat production is <strong>environmentally unsustainable</strong>, driving deforestation, biodiversity loss,
    and global greenhouse gas emissions. <strong>Cultivated meat</strong> offers a promising alternative, yet <strong>remains hindered by high production costs</strong>,
    particularly the <strong>price of recombinant growth factors</strong> that constitute <strong>up to 70% of total media expenses</strong>.
    Our project, <strong>Growf</strong>, tackles this challenge by engineering a <em>Komagataella phaffii</em> chassis,
    <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span>, designed to <strong>reduce exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion and improve recombinant protein yield</strong>
    through targeted genetic modifications in <em>Hoc1</em>, <em>Rho1</em>, and <em>PMI</em>. In parallel, we developed
    <strong>BioKernel</strong>, <strong>an open-access, no-code Bayesian optimisation framework</strong> that accelerates experimental design and strain engineering,
    enabling researchers to identify optimal conditions with minimal experiments.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Guided by <strong>Integrated Human Practices</strong>, we engaged <strong>world-leading experts across academia and industry</strong>
    to explore unspoken pitfalls of scaling in yeast chassis. Our <strong>Education</strong> efforts addressed public skepticism toward
    cultivated meat and synthetic biology, recognising that <strong>innovation cannot scale without public trust and investor confidence</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    We were on a mission to make all of our outputs, including genetic constructs, engineered strains, and software
    <strong>fully open-access</strong>, reaffirming our belief that <strong>science cannot scale without non-proprietary technology</strong>.
    We aimed to remove cost, accessibility, and licensing barriers in biomanufacturing, accelerating the scalability of cultivated meat
    and paving the way for a more sustainable, ethical, and open future for food.

  <!-- DROPDOWN START -->
  <div class="collapsible-content" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      The way we produce meat today is <strong>destroying our planet</strong>, and without a sustainable alternative, the cost will be existential.
      The livestock farming industry is <strong>a major contributor to environmental degradation</strong>, responsible for
      <strong>approximately 14.5% of all greenhouse gas</strong> emissions<sup>[1]</sup>.
      It drives biodiversity loss through deforestation and land-use conversion, while the extensive use of antibiotics in animal agriculture 
      accelerates the spread of antimicrobial resistance<sup>[2]</sup>.
      As the global population grows, <strong>the demand for protein will rise correspondingly</strong>, intensifying these pressures,
      forcing us to <strong>confront the urgent need for sustainable and nutritionally complete alternatives</strong> to conventional meat.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <strong>Cultivated meat has been presented as a promising solution</strong> due to its structural and nutritional similarity to traditional meat,
      providing a more natural alternative over plant-based substitutes. However, <strong>large-scale adoption remains limited by higher production costs</strong>,
      primarily associated with cell culture media and bioreactor scale-up<sup>[3]</sup>.
      <strong>Cell culture media,</strong> which supplies the nutrients and signalling molecules required for cellular growth, 
      <strong>includes expensive recombinant components such as growth factors.</strong> Scaling cultivated meat requires bioreactors of 200 to 20,000 L and 
      <strong>demands substantial quantities of these expensive media,</strong> preventing cost parity with conventional meat<sup>[3]</sup>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Techno-economic analyses consistently <strong>identify growth factors as the primary cost-drivers of cultivated meat production,</strong>
      contributing up to 70% of the total production costs<sup>[4]</sup>. To make cultivated meat economically viable, it is 
      <strong>essential to develop alternative, low-cost recombinant growth factor production systems.</strong> 
      Our project addresses this challenge by <strong>engineering <em>Komagataella phaffii (K. phaffii)</em>,</strong> also commonly referred to as 
      <em>Pichia pastoris</em>, to <strong>produce growth factors more efficiently</strong>, increasing yields and simplifying downstream purification — 
      a core determinant of production economics.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <em>K. phaffii</em> is a widely used strain in both academia and industry for recombinant protein production due to its 
      <strong>well-characterised promoters, eukaryotic post-translational machinery, and high secretion efficiency.</strong> 
      However, <strong>production inefficiencies arise from the secretion of exopolysaccharides (EPS), which co-purify with target proteins</strong>
      and increase purification costs<sup>[5],[6],[7]</sup>. 
      To mitigate this, we engineered <strong>a novel <em>K. phaffii</em> strain, <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span>, designed to reduce EPS secretion</strong> 
      by modulating key enzymes involved in mannose biosynthesis and cell wall formation. 
      By aiming to alleviate EPS-associated downstream burdens and carbon waste, <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span> improves growth factor yields and production prices.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Through this work, our goal is to <strong>accelerate the scalability of the cultivated meat industry</strong> by producing cost-effective recombinant growth factors, 
      and advocating for sustainable, ethical food production.

  <!-- DROPDOWN START -->
  <div class="collapsible-content" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <span class="highlight-green">Mannoless</span> is our <em>K. phaffii</em> strain engineered to minimise 
      <strong>exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion</strong>, with the goal of freeing up more cellular energy for recombinant protein production 
      and thereby increasing the yields of our proteins of interest. Specifically, we used 
      <strong>a three-pronged strategy to target cell wall integrity and protein glycosylation pathways</strong><sup>[5]</sup>.
    </p>

    <!-- Hoc1 -->
    <h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hoc1</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      The <em>Hoc1</em> gene encodes a mannosyltransferase required for cell wall construction. 
      Almost all industrial <em>K. phaffii</em> strains contain <strong>a single-base-pair deletion in <em>Hoc1</em></strong>, resulting in a frameshift introducing a premature stop codon, 
      presenting as a thinner cell wall. While this improves secretion and transformation efficiency, the disrupted linkage of cell wall mannose polymers 
      causes <strong>free mannan polymers to be secreted instead</strong>, leading to EPS being detected alongside the recombinant protein.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Our goal is to <strong>restore and downregulate the original <em>Hoc1</em> sequence</strong> to increase active site specificity and prevent EPS formation.
    </p>

    <!-- Rho1 -->
    <div>
    <h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Rho1</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <em>Rho1</em> is a global regulator of the cell wall integrity pathway in yeast. 
      Overexpressing <em>Rho1</em> introduces an additional layer of regulation by <strong>activating the production of β-1,6-glucan, which facilitates mannoprotein attachment</strong> 
      and may lower EPS secretion<sup>[8]</sup>. We introduce <strong><em>Rho1</em> overexpression</strong> into our strain as an 
      <strong>additional way to control cell wall integrity and impurity formation.</strong>
    </p>
    </div>

    <!-- PMI -->
     <div>
    <h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>PMI</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <em>Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI)</em> <strong>links energy production with GDP-mannose and cell wall biosynthesis</strong> in yeast. 
      It catalyses the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate in glycolysis to mannose 6-phosphate. 
      We will <strong>downregulate the PMI pathway to free up more glucose for cellular respiration</strong> and reduce the intracellular mannose concentration<sup>[9]</sup>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Together, these three modifications are projected to provide three key advantages: 
      <strong>increased cellular energy availability, reduced EPS secretion through improved cell wall integrity, and a simplified downstream purification process</strong> 
      for the recombinant protein. However, since these modifications will result in some trade-offs, experimental validation is key.
    </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Licensing restrictions -->
    <div>
    <h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Licensing Restrictions in <em>K. phaffii</em> Engineering</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      This genetic engineering effort encounters a secondary challenge: the 
      <strong>commercial licensing restrictions surrounding most industrial <em>K. phaffii</em> strains.</strong> 
      Even the most open variants, such as <strong>OpenPichia</strong><sup>[10]</sup>, still impose significant commercial limitations that complicate large-scale applications.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      To address this, we are <strong>assisting ChangeBio to develop and characterise more non-proprietary strains of <em>K. phaffii</em></strong> 
      for future use by iGEM teams, academic researchers, and beyond. These new strains, based on the Type strain YB-4290, 
      will employ split-marker integration edits with a Cre-Lox system to avoid the patent issues with CRISPR while 
      <strong>enabling genotypes and phenotypes comparable to those of established industrial strains.</strong>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We selected <strong>growth factors</strong> as our proof-of-concept proteins because they represent the most expensive and limiting components 
      of cell culture media, and therefore, of cultivated meat production. 
      Beyond this application, our platform can be adapted to produce other recombinant proteins, such as enzymes, hormones, or therapeutic factors, 
      making it <strong>a versatile chassis for sustainable recombinant production.</strong>

      <strong>BioKernel</strong> is our <strong>dry lab software platform designed to optimise experimental design and strain engineering</strong> 
      in synthetic biology. It applies <strong>Bayesian optimisation</strong> to guide biological experiments toward optimal outcomes using minimal resources. 
      The framework was developed to address a key challenge of biological research, the <strong>high cost and limited throughput of experimental testing</strong>, 
      by allowing researchers to systematically explore complex parameter spaces arising in biological experimentation without requiring coding expertise<sup>[11],[12]</sup>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <strong>Bayesian optimisation (BO)</strong> is a machine learning strategy that <strong>identifies optimal experimental conditions by iteratively learning from prior results</strong>. 
      It constructs probabilistic models balancing <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong>, enabling efficient optimisation even in high-dimensional, noisy systems 
      typical of biological research<sup>[12],[13]</sup>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We developed <strong>BioKernel</strong> as a <strong>no-code, modular Bayesian optimisation framework tailored to biological experimentation</strong>. 
      Its key features include:
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li><strong>Modular kernel architecture</strong> adaptable to diverse biological datasets.</li>
      <li><strong>Heteroscedastic noise modelling</strong> to handle variable experimental uncertainty.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible acquisition functions</strong> balancing exploration–exploitation trade-offs.</li>
      <li><strong>Batch optimisation support</strong> for parallel experimental design.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Additionally, to validate our framework, we conducted two complementary tests. 
      <strong>Retrospective analysis on published metabolic datasets</strong> demonstrated that BioKernel can reproduce known optima using significantly fewer 
      experimental iterations than the original studies. 
      For prospective validation, we will apply our algorithm to <strong>optimise astaxanthin biosynthesis in <em>E. coli</em> Marionette strains</strong><sup>[14]</sup>, 
      which contain twelve orthogonal, genomically integrated sensors enabling precise multi-dimensional induction control.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      <strong>BioKernel</strong> is the first iGEM software <strong>capable of performing advanced optimisation without requiring programming knowledge</strong>, 
      bridging the gap between computational modelling and experimental design. 
      By releasing BioKernel as an <strong>open-source tool</strong>, we aim to make rigorous, data-driven optimisation accessible to all experimental biologists, 
      accelerating the path from design to discovery and enabling <strong>more efficient synthetic biology research worldwide</strong>.

      Public understanding and trust in cultivated meat are still developing, and often shaped by <strong>confusion or skepticism toward synthetic biology</strong>.
      Our educational efforts aimed to strengthen <strong>trust in science, specifically synthetic biology within the public sphere</strong>, 
      by demystifying the process behind innovation and encouraging <strong>open, nuanced discussions</strong> rather than simple promotion.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We explored how people perceive scientific innovation through <strong>public surveys on cultivated meat and trust in science</strong>, 
      using these insights to guide every outreach material and event we designed. 
      Our goal was to <strong>bring synthetic biology and alternative proteins into everyday conversation</strong> naturally through curiosity, dialogue, and reflection, 
      while engaging all age categories.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We addressed the growing “<strong>techno-phobia</strong>” surrounding biotechnology by combining 
      <strong>clear science communication with bioethical reflection</strong>. 
      This approach encouraged <strong>critical and constructive engagement</strong> with the future of food and synthetic biology, 
      promoting awareness of and trust in innovation.

      Our Human Practices work guided the project’s direction at every stage, ensuring our science was 
      <strong>socially aware, ethically grounded, and practically relevant</strong>. 
      We conducted a broad investigation of the <strong>precision fermentation and cultivated meat ecosystem</strong>, 
      covering academic progress, industrial bottlenecks, and the evolving market landscape.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Through <strong>expert consultations</strong> across academia, entrepreneurship, intellectual property, and industry, 
      we gained insight into both the <strong>technical feasibility</strong> and <strong>societal impact</strong> of animal-free growth factors. 
      This process not only informed our <strong>experimental design and process optimisation</strong>, 
      but also made our team uniquely aware of industry-level precision fermentation, strain engineering, and protein manufacturing in yeast — 
      as well as the <strong>regulatory and investment realities</strong> shaping the alternative protein field.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      By engaging with diverse stakeholders, we built a project that not only addresses scientific and economic challenges 
      but also reflects on the <strong>social responsibility and future implications</strong> of cultivated meat technology. 
      These discussions helped us integrate <strong>ethical reflection and practical insight</strong> into every design decision.

    <h1 style="text-align: left;" class="animate-text-scramble">Summary</h1>
  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    With <strong>Growf</strong>, we aimed to create <strong>multi-layered impact</strong>: scientific, industrial, and societal.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    At the scientific and industrial level, our work directly addresses long-standing bottlenecks in recombinant protein manufacturing. 
    Through extensive stakeholder interviews and literature analysis, we identified core issues within the most commonly used yeast chassis, 
    <em>K. phaffii</em>. We then introduced <strong>novel genetic modifications</strong>, including targets like <em>PMI</em>, 
    which has not yet been discussed in the research literature. If our hypotheses are confirmed experimentally, 
    these modifications could significantly reduce the cost of recombinant protein production and simplify downstream purification, 
    saving both <strong>researchers time</strong> and <strong>industry resources</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Our <strong>BioKernel</strong> framework further strengthens this impact by dramatically shortening the experimental planning period. 
    By providing a <strong>no-code, user-friendly Bayesian optimisation tool</strong>, we made advanced computational design accessible to all biologists, 
    eliminating the barrier of programming knowledge while improving efficiency and reproducibility in the lab.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    All our innovations are <strong>entirely open-access</strong>. Every output of our project is intentionally made free for use by the global research 
    and industrial community, allowing anyone to build upon our findings without restriction. The motivation behind our 
    <strong>Change Bio collaboration</strong> stems from the same reason. With our future goal to develop fully 
    <strong>non-proprietary yeast strains</strong>, we are proving that such open-access technology is <strong>necessary</strong> to accelerate innovation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Our target industry, the <strong>cultivated meat sector</strong>, stands to benefit immensely. By <strong>lowering the costs</strong> tied to growth factor 
    production, scale-up, and downstream processing, our project tackles the industry’s largest economic and technical constraints. 
    The urgency of these improvements was repeatedly emphasised in our <strong>Human Practices interviews</strong> with world-leading figures from the bioprocessing industry. 
    Through these discussions, we explored the technical and economic <strong>bottlenecks</strong> of large-scale biomanufacturing in greater <strong>depth</strong> 
    than is typically addressed in academic settings. These insights highlighted why our project represents an <strong>unexplored necessity</strong> 
    within both research and industry. The depth of industrial knowledge we gained through this process has fundamentally shaped how we envision real-world implementation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Through our conversations, we understood how the future of this industry depends heavily on <strong>venture funding</strong>, 
    and that venture funding itself is shaped by <strong>public perception</strong>. 
    If the public does not believe in cultivated meat, investors will not either, and without their support, there can be no market to sustain innovation. 
    That’s why we took particular care to address this through our <strong>educational outreach</strong>, focusing not only on cultivated meat 
    but also on the broader acceptance of synthetic biology. We believe we reached a large number of people through our events and materials, 
    and even more indirectly through word-of-mouth.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Together, the projects behind <strong>Growf</strong> unite under one mission: <strong>to enable a better future for humanity</strong>. 
    Whether through accessible, sustainable protein production or by disrupting the path to innovation, 
    our work strives to redefine what it means for science to serve the world.
