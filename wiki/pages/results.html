  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Throughout our work in the lab this summer, we were able to establish the potential viability of mutant
    <em>K. phaffii</em> strains not characterised in literature with regards to our CRISPR modifications and our
    growth factor constructs.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    In particular, we were able to establish the potential viability of the <strong>Hoc1 downregulation-repair</strong>
    modification and the <strong>PMI downregulation</strong> modification, both of which would be novel to iGEM if
    further testing proves successful.

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We successfully demonstrated the transformation of electrocompetent <em>K. phaffii</em> with sgRNA plasmids quite early in our experiments.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We successfully assembled our sgRNA constructs as verified by gel electrophoresis. We expected a single band around 250 bp from the assembled construct, which we saw on all lanes with DNA added on the gel. We consequently gel purified this and were able to isolate a substantial amount of sgRNA for use in assembly.

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We were also able to successfully transform <em>E. coli</em> with our sgRNAs, giving us colonies to pick and sequence to determine if the sequence had been altered in any way due to errors in the bacterial polymerase. 
    (Below: image of PMI 2324 sgRNA, transformed into BB3cH backbone and amplified using TOP10 <em>E. coli</em>).

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We were able to successfully isolate the plasmids we amplified and quantify their concentrations by miniprepping. This gave us enough sgRNA plasmid for transformation. 
    We verified the correct assembly of sgRNA sequences by a test digest followed by full plasmid sequencing. 
    Six of the ten sgRNA plasmids we designed came back as 100% perfect clones, giving us the confidence we needed to run transformation.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We were unfortunately unable to fully confirm the success of our transformation protocol. We were unable to isolate a substantial mass of HR repair templates throughout our time in the lab, even when performing up to nine minipreps of 3 mL overnight cultures per template. 
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Each time we increased the number of minipreps and each time we failed to isolate enough plasmid to run a substantial number of transformations, we were reminded of the frustrating variability within synthetic biology and the limitations of yield on our experiments even when using various methods to concentrate our DNA.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Despite these setbacks, we saw some promising signs during our experiments. Our final round of transformation saw colonies grow on YNB–NRS plates — a sign that the HR repair template had been taken up into the <em>K. phaffii</em>. 
    We were unable to verify whether the templates were integrated or not by colony PCR. 
    We also experienced some filamentous fungi contamination in this round, but it seems that we were able to isolate uncontaminated colonies successfully, as we saw only one contaminated colony out of 35 that were inoculated.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We are unable to conclude confidently that these colonies are <em>K. phaffii</em> that have taken up the sgRNA–Cas9 plasmid and the HR template, had the template integrate into the genome at the correct locus, and had the Cas9 plasmid drop by removing hygromycin from the selective media. 
    Going forward, we plan to characterise these strains in shake flasks or deep well plates to gain an understanding of their culture conditions.

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our growth factor experiments were characterised by a substantial amount of troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our Golden Gate assemblies failed twice in a row, with the primary reason being a failure on our part to account for the size of the plasmid backbone when calculating out the molarity of our DNA sequences — causing some of our sequences to be over 10× more diluted than intended.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To account for this, we amplified all fragments by transforming <em>E. coli</em> and miniprepping overnight cultures. 
    We were able to increase the concentration of fragments substantially, allowing us to perform Golden Gate assembly with a reasonable final reaction volume.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our third Golden Gate assembly was successful, yielding bands for some of our samples. 
    We were unfortunately out of usable FGF plasmid, and the mCherry plasmid concentration was overreported by the Nanodrop, resulting in low assembly efficiency.
  </p>

  <div class="image-aligner-center">

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We purified these fragments and transformed them into electrocompetent <em>K. phaffii</em>. 
    This yielded positive transformants that grew on YNB–Zeo; however, we also observed significant filamentous fungi contamination on the selective plates.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We chose to re-streak these plates onto YPD–Zeo plates and incubate. We observed minimal contamination on most plates after one round of re-streaking. 
    This process was repeated once more, yielding YPD–Zeo plates with only <em>K. phaffii</em> growing.

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Though we were unable to verify the correct insertion or assembly of our construct in <em>K. phaffii</em>, we have reason to believe that we have strains capable of expressing recombinant human growth factors when induced with methanol.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Future testing will involve fermentations in deep well plates and colony PCR followed by amplicon sequencing to confirm that our modifications have taken place.

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Due to the lack of growth of our growth factor transformants, we were unable to isolate a successfully modified strain for characterisation work in a bioreactor. 
    We were, however, able to characterise a baseline run of the bioreactor with the trHoc1 Type strain PN-2 and record extremely helpful data concerning optimal run conditions and nutrient flow rates for culturing of 
    <em>K. phaffii</em> at scales larger than the benchtop.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We started with 25 mL of <em>K. phaffii</em> PN-2 culture in approximately 560 mL of buffered basal salts medium. 
    We observed the bioreactor foam up immediately, likely attributed to the high final cell density of our starting culture, and added some antifoam.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    After approximately 55 hours, we were able to harvest roughly 500 mL of liquid culture. 
    We observed that a non-trivial amount of media had been lost to evaporation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We pelleted each tube using a centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 minutes before filtering the supernatant. 
    We were able to isolate the wet cell pellet and the supernatant, a portion of which was filtered through 0.2 µm filters. 
    These filters almost immediately clogged, indicating the potential presence of large proteins and/or sugars remaining in the supernatant.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    We were unfortunately unable to quantify and characterise these large molecules in time for the wiki freeze. 
    We are presently continuing further investigation of this to present at the jamboree.

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    After a successful assembly and transformation of Stage 1 parts, we performed a colony PCR to assess the efficiency of parts insertion with this kit.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Of 76 colonies screened, 50 were positive, demonstrating the relatively high efficiency of correct transformation using this kit and its constituent plasmids.
