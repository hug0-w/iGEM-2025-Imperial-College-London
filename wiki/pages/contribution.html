  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our work advances the iGEM community through
    <strong>novel characterisation, data generation, and tool development</strong>
    in <em>K. phaffii</em>, a chassis essential for both academic discovery and
    industrial-scale protein production. Our contributions strengthen the open-source
    foundation for yeast synthetic biology by connecting molecular characterisation,
    data transparency, and computational optimisation in a unified framework.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We have characterised <strong>two previously unstudied genes</strong> central to
    <em>K. phaffii</em>’s sugar metabolism and secretion pathway, developed reproducible
    strain-provenance standards in collaboration with ChangeBio, registered multiple
    <strong>new growth-factor expression constructs</strong> to the iGEM Registry,
    produced validated laboratory protocols for yeast handling and transformation,
    and released <strong>BioKernel</strong> — a no-code Bayesian optimisation tool
    for synthetic biologists.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Together, these contributions empower future iGEM teams to engineer
    <em>K. phaffii</em> more effectively, accelerate discovery cycles,
    and increase the reproducibility and transparency of yeast-based projects.
    Every construct, dataset, and workflow is documented in our

      1. Characterisation of Hoc1: fixing a blind spot in <em>K. phaffii</em> engineering
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We are the first iGEM team to <strong>attempt to characterise the <em>Hoc1</em> gene in <em>K. phaffii</em></strong>,
    a key factor in recombinant protein secretion. The <em>Hoc1</em> gene encodes an
    α-1,6-mannosyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for building the outer mannan layer
    of the yeast cell wall. Despite its essential role in maintaining structural integrity,
    <em>Hoc1</em> remains largely uncharacterised within industrially relevant protein-expression systems.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Through our work, we examined how <em>Hoc1</em> influences
    <strong>exopolysaccharide (EPS) accumulation and downstream purification</strong>,
    revealing a trade-off between secretion yield and cell-wall robustness.
    Excess EPS increases viscosity and non-specific binding during purification,
    while overly weakened walls compromise cell viability.
    Our experimental assays sought to quantify this balance and
    provide concrete optimisation guidance for future strain designs.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    These findings have practical implications for smoother purification workflows and
    <strong>higher-yield, lower-cost expression systems</strong>,
    particularly relevant to the cultivated meat and precision fermentation industries.
    By opening a previously neglected part of the <em>K. phaffii</em> genome,
    this work establishes a reference point for how modifying
    cell-wall biosynthesis can directly impact protein production efficiency.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    All associated experimental data, design notes, and workflow documentation
    are archived in our

      2. First documented characterisation of Phosphomannose Isomerase (PMI)
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    The enzyme <strong>Phosphomannose Isomerase (PMI)</strong> catalyses the reversible conversion between
    fructose-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate — a critical step in the GDP-mannose biosynthetic pathway.
    In <em>K. phaffii</em>, this process governs the flow of carbon into mannose-based glycans, influencing
    glycoprotein folding, secretion efficiency, and carbon-flux distribution.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our work represents the first iGEM-level attempt to explore the consequences of
    <strong>PMI down-regulation</strong> on yeast physiology. We designed and constructed homologous recombination
    cassettes and guide RNAs to modulate PMI expression, aiming to redirect intracellular mannose pools
    toward central metabolism. This could enhance energy availability and reduce EPS overproduction,
    addressing two major bottlenecks in recombinant secretion systems.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    By studying these metabolic effects, we established a framework for linking sugar-pathway regulation
    to protein-production performance. This contributes a <strong>systems-biology perspective</strong> to chassis design
    and provides a foundation for future studies into flux balancing, glycosylation co-regulation,
    and adaptive metabolic control.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our data and constructs for PMI serve as the first open dataset connecting gene regulation
    to secretion efficiency in <em>K. phaffii</em>, creating opportunities for future synthetic biologists
    to refine energy use, improve yields, and streamline strain engineering.

      3. Open provenance tracking of <em>K. phaffii</em> strains
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To promote transparency and reproducibility in yeast synthetic biology, we partnered with
    <strong>ChangeBio</strong> to contribute practical validation data to their open-source
    framework, <a href="https://github.com/Change-Bio/PhaffiiNet" target="_blank" class="link-underline">
    <strong>PhaffiiNet</strong></a>. This platform applies the <strong>Strain Provenance Protocol (SPP)</strong>,
    a standardised method for documenting and tracing every genetic modification, transfer,
    and phenotype associated with a strain throughout its lifetime.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    While we did not originate the SPP standard or its underlying scripts, our work offers one of the first
    practical <strong>validation case studies</strong> demonstrating how iGEM teams can integrate this system
    into real laboratory workflows. By embedding provenance tracking into routine design–build–test–learn cycles,
    we demonstrate how open documentation strengthens reproducibility and ethical transparency.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    iGEM repositories already host sequences and parts, but rarely track the <strong>evolution of strains</strong>.
    With the growing scale of yeast engineering, ensuring version control for modified chassis has become a key
    ethical and technical priority. Our contribution lays the foundation for making provenance tracking
    a default part of strain management in academic and industrial projects.
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>
      <strong>Genesis Node with Whole Genome Sequence:</strong>
      We submitted a reference <em>K. phaffii</em> genome, free from licensing restrictions,
      as a “genesis node” within PhaffiiNet — the foundation from which future modifications can be traced.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trusted, Fully Documented Origin:</strong>
      The node establishes a transparent and open origin for a new strain lineage,
      reducing duplication and enabling collaboration without IP barriers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Living Example of Provenance Tracking:</strong>
      Our characterisation of <em>Hoc1</em> was logged as a “Modification Event,” followed by a
      “Snapshot Event” with phenotype data, serving as a concrete model of open genetic record-keeping.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Through these steps, we are turning <em>K. phaffii</em> from an opaque workhorse into a
    <strong>transparent, community-governed chassis</strong>.
    This collaboration shows how open-science practices can be implemented at every layer of the
    synthetic biology process — from construct design to strain validation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    In the long term, incorporating provenance systems like PhaffiiNet into iGEM’s infrastructure
    could allow for automated benchmarking of strain performance, transparent lineage tracking,
    and community-driven improvement across projects.

      4. Growth Factor Expression Constructs (HGF, IGF-1)
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To expand the iGEM Parts Registry with practical, validated tools, we designed and registered
    <strong>two new expression constructs</strong> for human <strong>Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)</strong> and
    <strong>Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)</strong>. These growth factors are central to
    cellular-differentiation and tissue-development pathways, making them highly relevant to regenerative medicine,
    tissue-engineering, and cultivated-meat research.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Each construct was assembled in a modular cloning framework that allows users to easily swap promoters,
    signal peptides, and terminators. Designs were verified <em>in silico</em> for codon optimisation in
    <em>K. phaffii</em> and annotated for cross-system compatibility. Using secretion tags and yeast-optimised
    regulatory elements, the constructs provide a <strong>plug-and-play platform</strong> for rapid expression
    of human growth factors in diverse biomanufacturing contexts.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    By combining engineering efficiency with transparent documentation, these additions deliver
    <strong>biologically validated growth-factor parts</strong> that future iGEM teams can reuse without repeating
    the entire design process. Each plasmid is accompanied by promoter strength, secretion pathway, and tag data
    to ensure reproducibility and integration with other expression systems.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Collectively, these parts strengthen the <strong>open-source toolkit</strong> for recombinant protein production
    in yeast, an essential step toward animal-free biomanufacturing. Detailed construct maps, sequences, and validation

      5. Novel Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS) and Optimisation Elements
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To complement our yeast-based constructs, we developed and characterised a suite of
    <strong>novel ribosome binding site (RBS) variants</strong> optimised for astaxanthin
    biosynthesis in <em>E. coli</em>. These elements were generated through an
    iterative computational–experimental workflow that balances translation efficiency
    with pathway flux control, reducing the need for random library screening.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our RBS variants were designed using thermodynamic folding models and subsequently
    validated through controlled expression assays. The resulting library spans a wide
    range of translation-initiation strengths, allowing users to fine-tune expression
    ratios between pathway enzymes and maximise yield. All sequences and experimental
    results are documented in our
    <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='notebooks') }}" class="link-underline">
      <strong>lab notebook</strong>
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    These data were integrated into our <strong>BioKernel</strong> optimisation software
    (see <a href="#software-contributions" class="link-underline"><strong>Software Contributions</strong></a>),
    which uses Bayesian optimisation to recommend the next most informative experiment.
    This synergy between computation and wet-lab testing provides an accessible model
    for future iGEM teams aiming to implement machine-learning-guided design in biological contexts.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We encourage future iGEM projects to expand this dataset across organisms such as
    <em>S. cerevisiae</em> and <em>K. phaffii</em>. Each RBS variant can be easily adapted
    thanks to our modular design principles, contributing to an open, reusable framework
    for quantitative expression control in synthetic biology.

      6. Protocols and Documentation
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Throughout our project, we established and refined a complete set of
    <strong>laboratory protocols for working with <em>K. phaffii</em></strong> — from
    transformation and culture preparation to protein induction, purification, and analysis.
    Each protocol was written, tested, and annotated to ensure clear reproducibility for future
    iGEM teams regardless of resource availability.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To maintain consistency and accessibility, each procedure follows a defined structure:
    <em>objective</em>, <em>materials</em>, <em>step-by-step protocol</em>,
    <em>expected results</em>, and <em>validation notes</em>. Troubleshooting
    advice, reagent concentrations, and equipment substitutions were carefully included
    to accommodate teams with limited access to advanced facilities.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    All experimental records are linked to the corresponding part entries in the iGEM Registry,
    ensuring that <strong>every construct can be traced from sequence to result</strong>.
    This structure bridges the gap between wet-lab data and registry documentation, making
    replication and verification seamless for future contributors.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">

      Software Contributions – BioKernel
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Addressing the challenge of optimising biological systems under limited experimental capacity,
    we created <strong>BioKernel</strong> — a <strong>no-code software platform</strong> that uses
    <em>Bayesian optimisation</em> to intelligently suggest the next most informative experiment.
    It enables teams to navigate complex design spaces while saving time, reagents, and effort.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Unlike conventional optimisation tools, BioKernel models <strong>non-constant measurement uncertainty</strong>,
    allowing it to handle the high variability typical of biological experiments. It translates advanced
    statistical concepts into a <strong>visual, intuitive interface</strong> designed specifically for
    synthetic biologists with little or no coding experience.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    The platform follows the <strong>Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL)</strong> workflow:
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Users input experimental parameters, objectives, and constraints (e.g., promoter strength, enzyme ratio, media composition).</li>
    <li><strong>Build & Test:</strong> BioKernel recommends experiments that maximise information gain based on its probabilistic model.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn:</strong> New results update the model in real time, refining predictions and improving accuracy for subsequent runs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    This adaptive loop <strong>maximises learning per experiment</strong>, allowing teams to extract maximum insight
    from limited data. Interactive visualisations display convergence and uncertainty maps,
    helping researchers balance exploration and exploitation in decision-making.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    BioKernel was used in our project to optimise <strong>RBS variants for astaxanthin production</strong>,
    reducing experimental overhead while maintaining predictive robustness
    (see <a href="#rbs-optimisation" class="link-underline"><strong>RBS & Optimisation</strong></a>).
    Future iGEM teams can use it to optimise growth media, promoter combinations,
    or bioproduction conditions across chassis.
  </p>

    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Education was at the heart of our outreach mission. We aimed to make synthetic biology more approachable,
    inclusive, and inspiring for learners of all ages — from children discovering science for the first time
    to university students shaping the field’s future. Our educational efforts combined hands-on learning,
    creativity, and accessibility across formats.

      Team, Career & Community Toolkit
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We developed a <strong>comprehensive toolkit</strong> to help student teams start, manage, and grow their synthetic biology initiatives.
    This includes our <em>“Getting Started with iGEM”</em> handbook, outlining how to form a team, plan a project, and navigate the competition.
    We also created <strong>Careers in Synthetic Biology</strong> guides, adaptable to different countries, that highlight diverse paths in academia,
    industry, and entrepreneurship.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To strengthen the community beyond competition, we built the <strong>SynBio Circle Community Guide</strong> — a resource for forming supportive networks
    across institutions. Additionally, our <strong>Mini-Jamboree Event Manual</strong> offers templates for hosting regional synbio gatherings,
    including logistics, budgeting, and workshop outlines.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong>Resources Contributed:</strong> Open-source handbooks, community toolkits, and event manuals that enable future iGEM teams
    to organise effectively, secure funding, and sustain long-term collaborative communities.

      Hands-on & Creative Learning Resources
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To make learning engaging and accessible, we designed <strong>interactive, age-adaptable resources</strong> that blend creativity with biology.
    These include the <em>Sir Loin plushie kit</em>, which helps explain cultivated meat to children through storytelling and play;
    our <strong>colouring and picture books</strong> introducing cell biology concepts; and classroom activities like the
    <strong>Marble Yeast Game</strong> and <strong>The Overlab</strong>, which teach teamwork in scientific environments.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We also developed multimedia content — including a <strong>2000s-style tabloid magazine</strong>,
    a <strong>Webtoon storybook</strong>, and a <strong>visual dictionary of synthetic biology terms</strong> —
    to merge science communication with design and media literacy. These formats encourage creative learning and
    can be reused for outreach events, school visits, or public festivals.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong>Resources Contributed:</strong> Printable kits, illustrated storybooks, and creative games that promote interactive science learning
    and can be freely adapted by educators and teams worldwide.

      Ethics, Media & Cross-Team Engagement
    </span>
  </h3>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    To complement scientific education, we built <strong>ethics and media engagement tools</strong> that foster critical thinking.
    Our web-based bioethics quiz, <em>The Moral Code</em>, guides players through moral dilemmas in biotechnology,
    exploring themes of consent, enhancement, and environmental responsibility.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    We supported the quiz with <strong>essay prompts, discussion packs, and classroom debate guides</strong>,
    enabling its integration into both secondary and higher education. Our <strong>podcast series</strong> extends this reflection,
    featuring stories from scientists, artists, and iGEM alumni at the intersection of ethics and innovation.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Alongside this, we launched the <strong>Digital Postcard Initiative</strong>, connecting iGEM teams globally through visual storytelling.
    Cross-team mentoring and international webinars further encouraged dialogue and peer learning across cultures.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong>Resources Contributed:</strong> Playable ethics quizzes, recorded podcasts, and collaborative outreach templates
    that promote reflection, communication, and interdisciplinary engagement across teams and communities.

    <span class="span-sky-blue animate-text-scramble">
      Human Practices Contributions
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Our <strong>Human Practices</strong> strategy connected every technical choice in the lab
    with its ethical, industrial, and societal implications. By embedding stakeholder input and expert validation
    into our design process, we transformed Human Practices into a genuine <strong>decision-making framework</strong>
    that guided our scientific and entrepreneurial directions.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    The insights we gathered — from researchers, bioprocess engineers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers —
    helped us ensure our project was both <strong>scientifically sound</strong> and <strong>societally relevant</strong>.
    We summarised our findings into practical rules and reproducible workflows to aid future iGEM teams
    in bridging the gap between science and application.
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>
      <strong>Technical decision rules:</strong>
      How the choice of chassis, such as <em>K. phaffii</em>, cascades into downstream consequences — from secretion behaviour
      to purification strategy and facility design. This framework helps teams integrate manufacturability early in their design phase.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Practical lab workflows:</strong>
      We compiled verified <strong>CRISPR, transformation, and expression protocols</strong> for yeast, including tips on
      <em>ΔKu70</em> strains, electroporation, and strain burden management. These methods reduce trial-and-error time
      for future teams and improve reproducibility.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Downstream & scale-up guidance:</strong>
      Consultations with industry professionals provided insight into purification bottlenecks, scale-up validation,
      and realistic bioreactor design expectations. These were condensed into a set of milestones for scale-readiness.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Regulatory, IP & commercial playbook:</strong>
      Through interviews with legal advisors and startup mentors, we mapped key hurdles — from GRAS certification
      to IP protection and licensing of microbial strains. This analysis also informed our support of open initiatives
      like <em>PhaffiiNet</em> for transparent, traceable biotechnology.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Network & resource map:</strong>
      We built a curated database of academics, companies, and government bodies who supported our research validation.
      This network provides a reusable entry point for future iGEM teams engaging similar stakeholders.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Stakeholder engagement templates:</strong>
      Our framework for stakeholder mapping, structured interviews, and ethical impact assessment ensures
      that feedback loops are systematic and results can directly influence project design.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Collectively, these contributions turn Human Practices into a <strong>strategic design discipline</strong>
    rather than a reporting requirement. They help future iGEM teams approach their projects holistically —
    combining ethical awareness, industrial feasibility, and scientific excellence.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    All transcripts, workflow templates, and guidance materials are available in our
    <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='notebooks') }}" class="link-underline">
      <strong>lab notebook</strong>
    </a>, where they can be freely accessed and adapted.
    We hope these resources empower upcoming teams to design responsibly, act transparently,
    and build technologies that genuinely serve people and the planet.
