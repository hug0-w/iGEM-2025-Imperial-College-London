    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"> The 2021 Uppsala iGEM team</a> served as a great inspiration to us, as they shared our vision of bringing cultivated meat to the wider world. 
        They were the first iGEM team to address the issue of growth factors and serum-free media in cultured meat, using <em>E. coli</em>. Their work focused on FGF2, employing rational engineering screens and FEP to improve binding affinity to FGFR.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        We also recognised the necessity for reliable and cost-effective growth factor expression, but approached the problem from the bottom up through consultations with industrial stakeholders and potential clients. 
        The decision to use <em>K. phaffii</em> originated from outreach to precision fermentation and purification experts.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        Similar to Uppsala, we opted for 6xHis tagging for bench-scale purification. For validation, we sourced mammalian cells, but chose immortalised satellite cells, as experts indicated these are common models for studying growth media.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        Though we initially considered engineering our growth factors like Uppsala, we decided to focus on fundamental contributions toward our chassis, enabling future teams and companies to benefit. This strategy also allowed us to engage a broader range of stakeholders.
