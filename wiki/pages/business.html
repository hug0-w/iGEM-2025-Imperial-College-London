    </div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">To support our entrepreneurial outreach and better our industrial understanding, we
        went through a series of business analyses to explore the feasibility of our idea compared to current and
        emerging markets.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Our belief going into these analyses was the following: <strong>in the next 50 years,
            the majority of the world will be consuming alternative proteins as opposed to traditional meat</strong>.
        Over the next decade, the cultivated meat market industry will skyrocket from roughly $2 B in 2025 to $230–630 B
        by 2040, the single <strong>biggest bottleneck will be growth media cost</strong> and sustainability. Growth
        factors currently drive up to 70% of production costs, keeping the industry from reaching price parity with
        conventional meat [1].</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Our hunch is that <strong>producers don’t need another academic cell-line innovation
            filled with patent licensing requirements</strong>. The market requires <strong>a cheap, reliable source of
            growth factors with a streamlined downstream processing workflow</strong>. Our goal is to <strong>remove the
            industry’s main cost barrier</strong> and unlock scale for hundreds of emerging cultivated-protein
        companies, directly supporting the impending FoodTech boom.</p>
</div>
<div class="page-section width-75" id="market-analysis">
    <h2 class="collapsible-trigger" style="text-align: left;">Market Analysis</h2>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p style="text-align: left;">To validate the financial feasibility of our idea, we answered the following
            questions:</p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li><strong>Is the Cultivated Meat Market big enough ($1 B &lt;)?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Does the path to an even bigger market exist? Will this problem scale?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Is thinking in an international market feasible?</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Since the market is untapped, why hasn’t the problem been solved yet?</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the following subsections, we will do our best to explain our reasoning why
            innovation right now is central.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Market Overview</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our target segment is the cultivated meat industry, with our adjacent verticals
            being cell therapy &amp; regenerative medicine, and vaccines &amp; biopharmaceuticals, making our idea
            multi-fold beneficial.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For this section, we focused specifically on our entry market.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The cultivated meat industry has been a hot topic in many mainstream consultancy
            and banking reports, being covered by McKinsey, Barclays and Kearney amongst many. [1]</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The market size as of now is scaling from a humble estimate of $1 B to $20 B by
            2030, with forecasts reaching $230 B and more by 2040. By 2040, cultivated meat will make up 35% of all meat
            products, overtaking vegan alternatives and challenging traditional meat’s dominance. [1] [2]</p>

           </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Investment Landscape</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Based on our human practices conversations, funding into cultivated meat startups
            has been scarce. Between 2016 and 2022, the industry attracted $2.8 billion in total funding, with North
            America leading at $701 million, followed by the Middle East and Europe. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The UK ranks second globally in deal count, confirming that our surroundings are
            well-equipped to support our project reach industry, but its cumulative investment in the sector lags behind
            greatly compared to other regions. This gap is expected to narrow as engineering biology has recently been
            designated a strategic investment priority in the UK, a development that is likely to benefit the cultivated
            meat industry as well [3].</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> Further, investment in the cultivated meat industry has been on a downturn since 2022, resulting in the closure of companies. 2023 can be seen as an inflection point between a time where there was a lot of hype around cultivated meat, with short term promises and unmet potential, causing investor panic leading to declining venture support.
        </p>

        <div class="image-aligner-center" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <!-- Image 2A -->

                     alt="Funding into cultivated meat"
                     class="section-image"
                     style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:100%;">
                <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <strong>Figure 2A. Total funding value into cultivated meat (&amp; seafood) from 2016-2022. [2]</strong>

        </div>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This confirmed that although the cultivated meat market is still up-and-coming and
            faces some acceptance issues, there is enough proof showcasing its importance and the loss-of-interest in
            the segment is more attributed to investor panic rather than the abandonment of the idea.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Technological Progress</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In just a decade, production costs plummeted from $250,000 for a proof-of-concept
            burger (2013) to a hypothetical $12 per pound of chicken breast (2021), making this a 99% drop powered by
            breakthroughs in cell culture media and bioprocess advances. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The over 155 startups worldwide are racing to find a competitive edge, with prices
            and yield being primary targets. Enabling access to high-yield growth media, would hypothetically decrease
            production costs by at least 50%, with further decrease during the downstream processing stage enabled by
            our <em>K. phaffii</em> platform, making our project a key enabler.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5916/business/business3.webp"
                 alt="Production price per pound of cultivated meat" class="section-image"
                 style="width:960px; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 80%;">
            <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Figure 3. Production price per pound of cultivated meat between 2013-2021. [4]</strong></div>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Consumer Acceptance</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There is a perception of overall market acceptance being low, but recent consumer
            surveys prove otherwise.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although awareness of cultivated meat remains uneven, ranging from 23-66% across
            different countries, even those where cultivated meat is already sold, like Israel or Singapore. In Africa,
            awareness reached 64%, and in Brazil 38%. European familiarity varies from 23% (Greece), to 73% (Slovenia),
            UK being in between with 50%. This data is showing that education and terminology matter more than exposure
            alone.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As our market entry poi    nt would be B2B growth factors-as-a-service, our project is
            only indirectly influenced by the consumer market. We would be required to improve not only consumers, but
            also our direct customers’ beliefs of the future of alternative media.</p>

            </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This poses the question, why hasn’t the growth factor issue been solved yet?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Based on our Human Practices conversations, the reason why cultivated <strong>meat
                companies seem to close down isn’t firstly due to a lack of affordable growth factors, but more so due
                to a market coordination failure likely caused by investor skepticism.</strong> Particularly, potential
            contract manufacturers which could stably supply large quantities of growth factors are disincentivised from
            developing the facilities to do so since there is currently no active market. This on the other hand is due
            to lacking investment in prospective cultured meat companies, with investors likely heeding doubt due to
            failed promises made by companies riding a wave of hype. Therefore, investor confidence must be regained
            through validation.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p style="text-align: left;">To explore <strong>the demand and profitability of our idea</strong>, we
            constructed a <strong>Lean Business Model Canvas</strong> to map our assumptions and guide our strategy. We
            chose this approach because Lean Canvases, <strong>based on the Lean Startup Methodology</strong>, allow
            ideas to be developed and communicated quickly, <strong>avoiding the time-consuming nature of traditional
                business plans</strong>. We focused on turning complex models into a single, visual overview that
            highlights <strong>the most critical elements: the problem, customer, and solution</strong>. This made it
            far easier to align our team, communicate the concept with stakeholders, and identify weak points early.
            Ultimately, using the Lean Canvas helped us <strong>lay the foundation for reconstructing our pitch deck
                with a sharper, investor-ready focus.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="collapsible-trigger" style="text-align: left;">Ideal Customer Profile</h2>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p style="text-align: left;">An <strong>Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is a detailed description of the type of
                organization that would gain the most value from our product</strong> and has the resources to pursue
            it. Developing an ICP allowed us to <strong>better understand who we are truly designing our solution
                for</strong>. While most iGEM projects focus primarily on academic use cases, we chose to go further by
            defining an ICP to <strong>determine which businesses a synthetic biology B2B like ours would realistically
                sell to</strong>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Developing our <strong>ICP</strong> helped us <strong>clearly define who benefits
                most from our solution</strong>, both technically and commercially. By understanding the
            <strong>specific characteristics of business that struggle with growth factor costs</strong> and
            scalability, we were able to <strong>identify the right industry partners to contact</strong> for our Human
            Practices outreach and ensure our conversations reflected real market needs. This process also
            <strong>strengthened our business case in front of investors</strong>, allowing us to justify our market

        <p style="text-align: left;">Finally, as part of our Human Practices outreach, we put together a Pitch Deck that
            went through multiple rounds of iterations before it reached its final version that we deemed
            investor-ready.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Regarding key conversations, the pitch decks was made possible through actionable
            feedback from Victoria Faber and Nelli Morgulchik, while the final version was tested through an investor
            pitch simulation with Dr. Pedro Lovatt Garcia, Hugh Bowen and Olivia Brown. These simulations were
            particularly valuable, as in an ideal scenario we would <strong>aim to pitch our idea to organisations such
                as Imperial Enterprise Lab, SOSV Ventures, and Creator Fund</strong>. Imperial Enterprise Lab serves as
            the first point of contact for Imperial-based ventures, offering early-stage support and incubation
            opportunities. In contrast, SOSV Ventures and Creator Fund specialise in deep tech and academic spinouts,
            making them <strong>highly relevant for the commercialisation of synthetic biology innovations like
